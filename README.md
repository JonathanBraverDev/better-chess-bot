# A better chess bot

Writing a chess bot the way I wanted, my code, my ideas, my optimizations, and my mistakes (of which there will be many).

chatGPT was and will continue to be an important part of my work on this project.
Without it, I'd get bored of writing code I already planned or overwhelmed by things I can't figure out in one go like the move structure.
(in other words, doing nothing at all)

My long-term goal is to create a database with moves and game results, including times when the evaluation caused an unexpected power shift.
It would probably require a deep learning network to fine-tune those behaviors, but first, I want to build my traditional bot.
